# CTR-Prediction
The purpose of this project is to build and test prediction models and find a strategy that beats standard classification algorithms

Here we'll implement the following operations...

1. Featurize categorical data using One-Hot-Encoding
2. Construct an OHE Dictionary
3. Parse CTR data and generate OHE features
4. CTR prediction and log loss evaluation
5. Reduce feature dimension via feature hashing
